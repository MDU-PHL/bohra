Bohra is microbial genomics pipeline, designed predominantly for use in public health, but may also be useful in research settings. 

It is designed to provide users with an easily accessible report of comprehensive analysis results of bacterial sequence data to for characterisation of single samples or for outbreak investigations or population studies.
