## Introduction

Bohra is microbial genomics pipeline, designed predominantly for use in public health, but may also be useful in research settings. 

Bohra was inspired by [Nullarbor](https://github.com/tseemann/nullarbor) to be used in public health microbiology labs for identification of epidemiologically relevant relationships. 

### Etymology

The name 'bohra', is the name of an exinct species of tree kangaroo that lived on the Nullarbor plain in Australia was chosen to reflect the fact that it was predominantly used to build trees, relies on snippy (named for a very famous kangaroo) and was inspired by nullarbor.
