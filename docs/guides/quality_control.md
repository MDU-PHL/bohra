# Sequence quality control

Assessing quality of your sequence data is vitally important to facillitate appropriate interpretations of genomic analysis results.

`bohra` provides some basic quality checks which can be useful to determine the quality of your data (summary tab of the analysis report). The pipeline will NOT remove anything, but will flag sequences which display features that could detrimentally impact the quality of the analysis.

**Summary table**

The `bohra` pipeline outputs a html report with all results for the pipeline that was run. The summary table will be the first or second tab (if you have run one of the [comparative pipelines](../usage/running_bohra.md#comparative-pipelines)) you see when opening up the file in your browser.
